# musicl

`musicl` intends to be a music library manager that allows creation of a music library with adding and removing songs, and flexible querying of the library. 

It is written in Rust but is still in very early development and may never be completed, I am writing it as a replacement for a PowerShell module that performs the same task with the wrong tools.
